# Looking Fox
[Live-Site](https://www.lookingfox.com)

Looking Fox is a CRM web app built in React. Currently, it aims to be a simplified CRM for professional photographers. It allows users to assign custom to do lists based on the sessions or packages they offer. This allows photographers to see exactly where they are with their clients in the booking/shooting process, without having to spend a lot of time customizing a CRM to fit their needs. 

## Goals

In building Looking Fox, I wanted to write clean and concise code, have good component reuse, and use many tables in Postgres to store and access data. Writing components to be reused has changed how I approach building components and how I organize my app's structure. 


## Tech

React | Material UI | Bootstrap | Postgres | Express | Express-Session | Redux | Auth0 | Massive 


## Next Up
I will be refining features in the Dashboard, like adding color organization, adding a date-picker, and allowing the user to edit session types. 

I'll be adding Stripe elements to set up a subscription service in the settings panel. 

I'll be adding an email feature where users can send template emails to clients by clicking on a to do list item. 

These features will be added as quickly as possible. However, I am doing some contract work that will take priority.
